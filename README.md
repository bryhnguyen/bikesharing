# Overview

This project demonstrates the utility that Tableau can provide in presenting data visualizations in a more digestible, user-friendly interface using Tableau Stories. For presenting data from a bike-sharing service that has been established in New York City to investors to show how the successfulness of a service that can be implemented in the Des Moines area. 7 different graphs are used to display information about users, amount of trips taken, as well as accountability for repair and maintenance during less active hours.

# Results
Trips by Weekday Per Hour
![Trips_by_Weekday_Hour](https://i2.paste.pics/3874685812b9efc63e4931b3992b3532.png)
This graph provides a heatmap of the count of trips during all hours of every weekday to show when the most active and least active times the bike-sharing service is being used. The darker the intensity (red) is more active than the ligher the intensity (yellow). We can see that the hours of 5PM-7PM are the most active times for the service, Monday through Friday, with an exception of lighter volume in those times on Wednesday.

This graph also displays a heatmap of the count of trips during all hours of every weekday to also include the gender (Male, Female, or Unknown) that a user identified with. There is no indication that at any other hours, one gender will use the service more. It can be confirmed that 10AM-4PM are less active hours during weekdays for all genders. 

Checkout Time for Users

This line chart shows the duration of the trips a user will check out a bike for. Most users will check out a bike for a maximum of 5 minutes, indicating that the service is typically used for short commutes between other locations in the city. This would allow the bikes to be used again by other users within a short radius.

Another line chart sorts the users by gender to identify if any gender uses the bikes for a different amount of time. Males are shown to use the bikes the most, but unknown gender data shows that untracked/unknown gendered users use the bikes more frequently from 5-25 minutes. 

User Trips by Gender by Weekday

This graph displays users by the type of user (annual subscriber vs customer) and days the service is most active. We see regular customers most frequently use the bikes Friday through Saturday, implying that these are visitors in the city. For subscribers, the opposite is true. They are more active on the weekdays, showing that they might use this service to commute to work.

Customer Type Concentration

This pie chart reinforces the previous chart by showing the concentration of annual subscribers at 81% of 2 million trips. Subscribers may heavily rely on the service to improve their commute and travel in the city. Customers use the service for tourism and recreation. 

Trips per BikeID

This bubble chart allows for us to identify which bikes have the most or least number of trips on them to forecast which bikes will need to have more frequent repairs and maintenance or will need to be rotated with another bike. The slider in the top right allows the counts to be filtered to show which bikes have more or less trips. 


# Summary 

Overall, this is a highly utilized service in New York City due to the close proximity of housing, workspaces, and recreational venues. Because of the high volume of trips by users, we can see that this is a reliable service with regular daily users. Also, for visiting customers, the bikes are a valuable form of transit for weekend activities. Two additional visualizations could be used to show cost of maintenance and acqusition of the bikes, and also if there are varying models of the bikes that have different counts of trips.
